# DataStructureHowTo
Handwritten diverse and common data structures with clean and well-annotated C++ implementation for systematic learning toward Data Structure.

## Support Features
* Four classes of diverse and common data structures, the order should be `Linear -> Tree -> Set -> Graph`
* Include not only implementation and usage, but also some applications of them
* The implementation is in the generic programming pattern with template class

## Note
Most of the data structures are introduced in [Data Structure: Principle and Practice](https://book.douban.com/subject/30855210/) by [Huiyu Weng](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=78) and [Yong Yu](https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu), which is also the main reference I refer to.
